 can't definitively determine the meaning of "losem100" based on the information I have. Here are some possibilities:

It could be a product code or reference.  My search results found "losem100" on an Etsy listing related to 100 orange crystal beads [Etsy]. This suggests it might be a product identifier used in a specific context.

It could be a misspelling. "Lose" could be a misspelling of "loose" or "loss." Without more context, it's difficult to say for sure.

It could be a specific term in a niche field.  There might be a specific term "losem100" used in a particular domain or community that I'm not familiar with.

If you can provide additional context or information about where you encountered "losem100," I might be able to offer a more precise explanation.
